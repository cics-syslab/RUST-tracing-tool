On the other hand, <strong>RUST</strong> is a more recent language that has rapidly gained popularity due to its focus on safety, especially around memory management and concurrency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Systems Specialization</strong>: The focus of this research lies in <strong>low-level computing</strong>, which involves topics such as <strong>Operating Systems</strong>, <strong>Programming Languages</strong>, and <strong>Compilers</strong>. These are crucial for developing performance-critical systems where low overhead and precise resource management are key.</p></li><li><p><strong>History of C++</strong>: Introduced in the 1970s, <strong>C++</strong> has seen constant evolution, including support for object-oriented programming, template metaprogramming, and low-level memory manipulation. However, its design has also led to notorious issues around <strong>security</strong>, primarily due to manual memory management and lack of built-in safety features.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Rise of RUST</strong>: <strong>RUST</strong> was released in <strong>2013</strong> by Mozilla Research, and it was designed to address common problems in C++ by providing modern solutions to <strong>memory safety</strong> and <strong>thread safety</strong>, without sacrificing performance. The key feature of RUST is its <strong>borrow checker</strong>, which ensures memory access without the need for a garbage collector.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance and Debugging Comparison</strong>: With <strong>fewer runtime errors</strong>, <strong>better debugging tools</strong>, and a focus on <strong>memory safety</strong>, RUST is expected to reduce many of the issues that typically plague C++ programs, such as segmentation faults or dangling pointers. This research aims to determine if these advantages also lead to better <strong>performance metrics</strong> when comparing the two languages.</p></li><li><p><strong>Research Objective</strong>: The main objective of this research is to assess whether RUST can outperform C++ in systems-level programming tasks, particularly in terms of resource usage like <strong>clock cycles</strong>, <strong>memory consumption</strong>, and overall <strong>execution speed</strong>. The underlying hypothesis is that newer programming paradigms introduced by RUST should lead to <strong>better performance</strong> and fewer critical errors in practical applications.</p></li></ul><h2 id="methods" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#methods"><span>Methods</span></a></h2><p>This study uses the <strong>x86 architecture</strong> to perform a side-by-side comparison of <strong>RUST</strong> and <strong>C++</strong> performance. The research methodology revolves around two key approaches: <strong>Tracing</strong> and <strong>Analyzing</strong>.</p><h3 id="tracing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tracing"><span>Tracing:</span></a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Trace Runtime of Programs</strong>: The study involves running identical programs written in <strong>RUST</strong> and <strong>C++</strong> and tracking their behavior at the lowest level. The <strong>trace</strong> refers to recording the <strong>execution path</strong> of each program, capturing every operation that the CPU performs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Decompile to Assembly</strong>: All <strong>high-level code</strong> from both RUST and C++ is decompiled into <strong>x86 assembly</strong> code, which is the machine-level language that the CPU understands. This ensures that we are evaluating the actual instructions the processor is executing, regardless of how high-level syntax differs between the two languages.</p></li><li><p><strong>Track Multiple Program Runs</strong>: To ensure accurate and representative data, multiple program runs are traced for each language. This is necessary due to factors such as cache usage and different optimization paths taken by the compiler.</p></li></ul><h3 id="analyzing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#analyzing"><span>Analyzing:</span></a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Mapping Instructions to CPU Clock Cycles</strong>: Each assembly instruction is mapped to the <strong>number of CPU clock cycles</strong> it consumes. The goal is to determine how efficiently each language uses the CPU to execute identical tasks, as more clock cycles typically indicate inefficiency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Comparing Code Logic</strong>: By analyzing the <strong>assembly instructions</strong>, we can get a clear understanding of how the <strong>code logic</strong> differs between RUST and C++. This includes operations such as <strong>loops</strong>, <strong>function calls</strong>, and <strong>memory access patterns</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Identifying Performance Bottlenecks</strong>: Special focus is placed on pinpointing areas where <strong>C++</strong> may cause performance issues, such as <strong>memory allocation</strong>, <strong>pointer dereferencing</strong>, and <strong>cache misses</strong>, while evaluating if RUST&#39;s <strong>ownership model</strong> and strict memory management rules result in fewer bottlenecks.</p></li></ul><h2 id="programs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#programs"><span>Programs</span></a></h2><p>The programs used for the comparison consist of various <strong>benchmarking tasks</strong> designed to evaluate key performance characteristics, such as <strong>instruction throughput</strong>, <strong>memory usage</strong>, and <strong>execution time</strong>.
