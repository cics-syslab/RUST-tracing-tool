The following repository consists of the source code, example programs, data, documentation, and manuscripts for Kushagra Srivastava's 2024 Honor's Thesis: Comparing and Contrasting between RUST and C++ Performance Metrics. The comprehensive study spanned 18 months of research, with failed attempts recorded for future preservation as well. 

A documentation website for the project is under development as well, as well as a better graphical interface for using the tools.
