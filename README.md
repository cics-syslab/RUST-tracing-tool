PS: I have been working on these pieces of code since the past 2 months on my local machine, and am only now uploading it here. Work is still in progress, I am using a Colab Instance for my Computing needs. Here's a quick proof that I have been working on these for a while

PS: This also includes Prof. Chiu's Python Bytecode Tracing Tool, as I had used it for prelimnary understanding.

PS 2: I am migrating to Codespaces from Colab for this project. Reasons include:

1. Prof. Chiu being able to see where I am at this project, as well as my commits (Independent Study Deliverables)
2. Codespaces is just plain better. From no terminal lag to persistency, it's amazing :D
3. I missed git on Colab tbh
